/**
 * This package contains the Speedith Reasoning Kernel (or
 * <span style="font-style:italic;">SRK</span>).
 * <p>SRK is an API that provides a subsystem for reasoning with {@link
 * speedith.core.lang.SpiderDiagram spider diagrams}.</p>
 * <p>SRK provides the following features:
 *  <ul>
 *      <li>
 *          <span style="font-weight:bold">Inference rule application</span>:
 *          manages the application of inference rules on spider diagrams. It
 *          provides the ability for a sequential composition of inference
 *          rules (i.e.: applying a new inference rule on a particular spider
 *          diagram, removing the last applied inference rule etc.).
 *      </li>
 *      <li>
 *          <span style="font-weight:bold">Proof trace</span>:
 *          keeps a browsable and exportable history of currently applied
 *          inference rules.
 *      </li>
 *      <li>
 *          <span style="font-weight:bold">Proof state</span>:
 *          manages a proof state (i.e.: the initial spider-diagrammatic goal
 *          with subsequent intermediate subgoals). Inference rules act on the
 *          current proof state (which contains a set of spider diagrams as a
 *          set of remaining proof obligations). The inference rule can pick any
 *          one or more spider diagrams from the current proof state.
 *          TODO: Think about how the user can specify on which subgoal to apply
 *          the inference rule (maybe have inference rules that work on many
 *          subgoals -- provide many interfaces to the inference rules? one for
 *          single subgoal- and the other for multiple subgoal- inference
 *          rules).
 *      </li>
 *  </ul>
 * </p>
