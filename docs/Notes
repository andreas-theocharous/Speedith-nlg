Here is the build process on my personal computer (running Fedora 16, all the
dependencies are available in the regular repository):

    ant -Dlibs.ANTLRv3.classpath=/usr/share/java/antlr3-runtime.jar \
        -Dantlr3.tool.executable=antlr3 \
        -Dlibs.JakartaCLI.classpath=/usr/share/java/commons-cli.jar \
        -f devel/Speedith/build.xml jar

The I ran:

    java -cp "/usr/share/java/commons-cli.jar:/usr/share/java/antlr3-runtime.jar:./devel/Speedith.Core/dist/Speedith.Core.jar:../inductive_circles/devel/iCircles/dist/iCircles.jar:./devel/Speedith/dist/Speedith.jar" speedith.Main

    java -cp "./devel/Speedith.Core/dist/Speedith.Core.jar:/usr/share/java/antlr3-runtime.jar:/usr/share/java/commons-cli.jar:./devel/Speedith/dist/Speedith.jar:../inductive_circles/devel/iCircles/dist/iCircles.jar" speedith.Main
